## Introduction
Let’s explore Linux, a very important Operating System in today’s tech world. This guide will take you through its origin story. We like to dictate it as a story so it is easy to remember, different flavors, and a few simple commands so you can get started easily with your journey.

## Section 1: The Story of Linux
Linux began with Unix which created in the late 1960 by a team at AT&T's Bell Labs, including Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.

Later in 1991, Linus Torvalds started working on the Linux kernel because he wanted something better.  

By combining his kernel with GNU tools, he created a free operating system that anyone could use.

## Section 2: Discovering Linux Flavors
Linux comes in many versions called distributions, or distros. Each one is designed for different users and needs. Some examples are:

- **Ubuntu**: This one is great for beginners.
- **Linux Mint**: This is more simplistic and great for everyday use.
- **Zorin OS**: If you are coming from Windows OS, this is a nice choice.
- **elementary OS**: This is stylish, similar to Mac.
- **Fedora**: This is for staying up to date with new features.

Feel free to go wild and explore what works best for you!!!
